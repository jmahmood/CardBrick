# CardBrick

MVP flashcard app for Trim UI Brick.

See [docs/](docs/index.md) for more.

## Design Spec

CardBrick is developed in stages:

1. **Environment Setup** – configure the cross‑compile toolchain and build skeleton code.
2. **Core Deck Logic** – handle flashcard storage, review scheduling and persistence.
3. **UI Integration** – render cards and capture user input on the Trim UI Brick.
4. **Polish and Deployment** – finalize user experience and package releases.

The project uses CMake with optional cross‑compile toolchains. Build instructions are in `docs/index.md`.
